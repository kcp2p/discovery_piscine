# Discovery Piscine at 42Bangkok

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises and projects I completed during the Discovery Piscine at 42Bangkok.

For the final project, the rush portfolio, please check it out [here!](https://github.com/kcp2p/discovery_piscine-rush)

## What I learned

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

I learned how to use these programming languages altogether to build a website.

I have to give a special shoutout to Mr. Wave for tutoring me (even though he wasn't assigned to tutor my group), he gave me several ideas of edge-test cases.
